                <p class="style-text-body">Concrete examples of &ldquo;Intelligent Agents&rdquo; solving problems in real-world, military-relevant domains are not widespread.&nbsp; The promise of Intelligent Agents &ndash; autonomous, inter-communicating programs capable of performing
                    complex tasks &ndash; has given rise to a number of agent architectures.&nbsp; These architectures, however, are merely the infrastructure for implementing agents &ndash; neither intelligence nor autonomy is guaranteed.&nbsp; To move
                    towards the goal of truly intelligent agents, we need to integrate these agent architectures with powerful, well-understood Intelligent Systems technology.&nbsp; For example, in a recent project the following Intelligent Systems were

                </ol>
                <p class="style-text-body">We demonstrated agents in more pro-active roles as well.&nbsp; We have used agents in a network resource maintenance role, creating a distributed Tactical Operating System (TOS) that is more robust and more fault-tolerant in the unreliable
                    network environment of the battlefield.&nbsp; We joined this distributed system with a client agent that is capable of diagnosing and repairing failures in the client&rsquo;s connection to the TOS.&nbsp; By utilizing both of these
                    agents, we create an environment in which the user can utilize the TOS normally, even during a failure condition.&nbsp; The underlying agent architecture can maintain the user&rsquo;s access to a network resource, and only alert the
                    user in the case of fatal errors.</p>
                <p class="style-text-header">
                    <span style="font-weight: bold">ArtisTech Agent Examples</span>
                </p>
                <p class="style-text-body">
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">Listeners</span>: A Listener agent is responsible for monitoring a source of data for new information.&nbsp; When new information is available, it is packaged into a Message and tagged with a unique string that represents the type
                    of data contained within, as well as the name and location (that is, network host) of the Listener agent.</p>
                <p class="style-text-body">In a tactical system that ArtisTech developed, there were several Listeners.&nbsp; The most important is an &ldquo;alert&rdquo; agent.&nbsp; This agent is responsible for monitoring a stream of sensor data, and looking for hostile or unknown
                    entities that are within a specified distance of a friendly unit.&nbsp; When such a unit is detected, the position of the entity is packaged and sent to all agents that are listening for messages from the alert listener.</p>
                <p class="style-text-body">Another Listener is responsible for monitoring the audio feed from the Fire Teams&rsquo; microphones.&nbsp; This audio is captured by the Speech Server and parsed using an Augmented Transition Network (ATN) parser.&nbsp; The parsed speech
                    is captured by the audio listener agent, which transmits the information to the rest of the system.&nbsp; Another agent &ndash; the Position listener &ndash; performs a similar function with GPS positional data.&nbsp; In this case,
                    the position listener monitors the position of a single unit in TOS, and broadcasts changes to other agents in the system.</p>
                <p class="style-text-body">
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">Analyzers</span>: Analyzers are agents that collect data from Listeners and analyze that data to discover events or patterns of interest to the user.&nbsp; A single analyzer may require data inputs from a number of listeners, or may
                    record a log of all data received for temporal analysis.&nbsp; When an analyzer discovers data of interest, it packages this data into a message (including the messages from the listener containing the data), and broadcasts that message
                    to all interested agents.</p>
                <p class="style-text-body">In the tactical example, the most prominent analyzer is the Speech analyzer.&nbsp; For every audio listener, there is a speech analyzer that is responsible for determining whether a given string of spoken text is a unit identification.&nbsp;
                    This analysis is performed using a Bayesian Belief network that considers the arrangement of words within a spoken sentence, the words themselves, and the amount of &ldquo;noise&rdquo; words (words we are not interested in) contained
                    within the sentence.&nbsp; If the probability output by the network exceeds a specified threshold, a message is sent to all interested agents indicating that a unit identification has occurred.</p>
                <p class="style-text-body">A different kind of analyzer, referred to as a
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">Correlator</span>, is responsible for detecting patterns in messages from other agents.&nbsp; In the tactical system, we use two Correlators.&nbsp; The first is an agent responsible for capturing all &ldquo;alert&rdquo; events, and
                    matching them with &ldquo;identification&rdquo; events, producing a single &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; event in which a soldier has been alerted to the presence of an unknown unit, and then identified that unit.&nbsp; This agent utilizes
                    JESS, using a set of rules about the temporal and geographic coincidence of events.&nbsp; A second correlator is responsible for removing redundant events from this system &ndash; for example, a second, redundant unit identification
                    event for the same Unknown entity.</p>
                <p class="style-text-body">
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">Planners:</span> Planners are agents that aid in a user&rsquo;s decision-making process by generating and analyzing possible responses to an event.&nbsp; This process often includes interaction with a human user.&nbsp; In the tactical
                    system, the Planning process is actually spread across several agents.&nbsp; The first is the Planner, an agent that captures an &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; event, queries the positions of all available friendly units, and generates a
                    set of possible responses to the encounter. &nbsp;A separate agent, the Handler, performs some automatic scoring on these plans, and presents the list of plans to the Commander.</p>
                <p class="style-text-body">
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">Monitors</span>: Once a response plan is selected by the Commander, the execution of that plan is delegated to a Monitor agent.&nbsp; Monitor agents collect data from the Listeners attached to all units involved in the execution of
                    the plan.&nbsp; This sensor input drives the monitor&rsquo;s internal Finite State Machine, allowing the agent to track the execution of the plan until an end state &ndash; task completion, task interruption, or re-planning &ndash;
                    occurs.&nbsp; Once a completion state has been reached, a message indicating that the entire chain of events (from sensor input to completed plan) has been resolved is broadcast to other agents in the system.</p>
